默认240px\r\n  vColor:color，魔方材料颜色 ,默认#999\r\n  colors:[[][][][][][]]，魔方各个面的颜色，默认正常魔方的颜色\r\n  order:num 魔方阶乘 ,默认3阶\r\n  mouseSen 拖拽时鼠标灵敏度 , 默认0.5\r\n  oneTime 转动一下时需要的毫秒时间，默认500\r\n  oneTimeBatch 批量扭动时转动一下所需要的时间 默认200\r\n  turnOn:true  是否在魔方上点击扭动 默认是\r\n  turnArrowColor:pink; 箭头颜色,默认PINK\r\n  cache:true  是否缓存魔方信息，以便下次打开此浏览器继续\r\n  turnBack:fn   每次扭动后的毁掉函数，参数为扭动的轴列方向 {coor:,num:,dir:}\r\n}\r\n\r\n此对象的方法： \r\n常用：\r\n  turn(coor,num,dir,comebackfn);//基础的扭动方法,参数coor：扭动那个轴方向的魔方，num：扭动这个轴的第几层的魔方，dir：方向,正方向turn 反方向false，combackfn:扭动完成后的回掉函数\r\n  turn3(t);//仅限于3阶魔方的扭动，t可为 u,u',b,b'……(三阶魔方的指令，'是反方向的意思);\r\n  turn3s(ts);//仅限于3阶魔方,ts是三阶魔方指令的组合。例如 var ts='uu\\'bb\\'lr\\'f';注意字符串中的'要转义\r\n  initColor();//初始化魔方最开始的样子。步数同步清零\r\n  initL();//初始化魔方旋转的角度\r\n  getFoots();//返回当前已经扭的步数\r\n  random(n);//随机打乱魔方，n为随机打乱的步数。默认30步\r\n  back();//撤销一步\r\n\t\r\n不常用：\r\n  delColor();//干掉颜色。只剩材料颜色\r\n  setColor(colors);//自己设定颜色,colors为2维数组\r\n  setMouseSen(n);//设置鼠标拖拽魔方的灵敏度\r\n  setOneTime(time);//设置魔方扭动速度- 毫秒时间。\r\n*/\r\nvar GameCubePlugin = {}\r\nfunction Cube(a, b) {\r\n  this.id = a;\r\n  this.container = document.getElementById(a);\r\n
